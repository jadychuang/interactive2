	<h2>Part 1 of 5: Stretching</h2>
	<ol>
			<img src="images01.jpg"><br>

		<li>
			<strong>Find a space in your house where you can be alone and comfortable.</strong> Like many isometric exercises, facial exercises can look and feel somewhat awkward in the beginning. Sit upright in a chair, taking care to have good posture.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Stretch your neck before beginning your facial exercises.</strong>All these movements should be done slowly, while breathing deeply. Tilt your head down and raise it back up a few times.
			<ul>
				<li>Slowly move your chin from one shoulder blade across your chest to the other shoulder blade.</li>
				<li>Look over each shoulder for a count of 5 seconds. Repeat this twice.</li>
				<li>Tilt your head to the right, as if you want to rest your head on your shoulder. Hold for 10 seconds. Repeat on the left side. Return to a neutral neck position to begin your facial routine.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>


<div id="two">
	<h2>Part 2 of 5: Eye exercises</h2>
	<ol>
					<img src="images03.jpg"><br>

		<li><strong>Look to your right side, while keeping your face pointing forward.</strong>Hold for 5 seconds. Move your eyes to your left side for 5 seconds.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Look up for 5 seconds. Look down for 5 seconds. Look diagonally for 5 seconds in each direction. Now, turn your head to the left and look in corresponding directions. Repeat exercise 2 to 10 times for both sides.</li>
				<li>This eye workout can reduce drooping eyelids and it can also refresh your eyes if you work on a computer or watch television for long periods of time. You can also do this exercise with your eyes closed.</li>

		<li><strong>Raise your eyebrows and hold them for 5 seconds.</strong> Open your eyes as wide as you can and allow your mouth to frown. Repeat five times.</li>

		<li><strong>Look up at the ceiling.</strong>Pucker your mouth as if you are going to kiss something. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 5 times.</li>
			<ul>
