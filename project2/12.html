<h1>THE&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROAD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAKEN</h1>
<h4><em>by robert frost</em></h4>

<div id="text">
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>


<div id="text">
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,</div>


<div id="text">
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>


<div id="text">
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood and I,<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.</div>
