<h1>The Road not taken</h1>
<h4><em>BY ROBERT FROST</em></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Two roads diverged in a <em><strong>yellow</strong></em> wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</li>


<li>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</li>


<li>And both that morning equally lay
In <em><strong>leaves</strong></em> no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</li>


<li>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a <em><strong>wood</strong></em>, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</li>
</ul>
