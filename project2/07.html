<h1>THE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAKEN</h1>
<h2><em>by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;robert &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frost</em></h2>
<div>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br><br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br><br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br><br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br><br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>

<br><br>
<div>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br><br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br><br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br><br>
Though as for that the passing there<br><br>
Had worn them really about the same,</div>
<br><br>

<div>And both that morning equally lay<br><br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br><br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br><br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br><br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>

<br><br>
<div>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br><br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br><br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br><br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br><br>
And that has made all the difference.</div>
